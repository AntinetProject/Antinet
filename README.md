# Antinet
this contains a list of websites and the browser, download this and youve got the whole antinet, so you never have to worry about viruses, worms, or anything, unless you want to be connected to the internet
so its the internet, but how is it more secure
good you asked, the internet communicates in something called packets, and everyone is assigned an ip address
each packet has a source and destination, and stuff like worms can only travel if you are using that system
however, they cant spread if it doesnt have that
so we created the antinet, short for antivirus network, just like the internet is interconnected network
its a really cool project, and we will continue updating it
